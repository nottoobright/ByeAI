# ByeAI

**A crowdsourced browser extension to hide AI-generated content on YouTube.**

As large language and vision models become more accessible, YouTube is seeing a flood of low-effort, AI-generated content. ByeAI gives the community the power to collectively filter and hide these videos, creating a better viewing experience for everyone.

## How It Works

1.  **See AI Content? Flag It:** When you identify a video that uses AI for its script, voice-over, or visuals, you can flag it with one click using the inline button or the popup menu.
2.  **Community Consensus:** Each flag is weighted by the user's anonymous reputation score. When enough independent users flag a video, its score crosses a dynamic threshold.
3.  **Hidden for Everyone:** Once the threshold is met, the video is automatically hidden from view for all ByeAI users, cleaning up their home, search, and "up next" feeds.

## Features

*   **Community-Powered Filtering:** Relies on the collective wisdom of users to identify and hide AI-generated content.
*   **Anonymous & Private:** No user accounts or personal data required. Your identity is a randomly generated hash stored only on your computer.
*   **Reputation System:** Users who consistently agree with the community consensus have their votes weighted more heavily, preventing bad actors from abusing the system.
*   **Category Selection:** Flag videos based on specific categories (AI-script, AI-voice-over, etc.).
*   **Customizable:** Choose which categories of AI-generated content you want to hide from the settings page.
*   **Import/Export:** Back up and restore your personal blocklist.
*   **Open Source:** The code for the extension and the server is fully open-source to encourage trust, transparency, and community contributions.
