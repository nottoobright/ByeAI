<h1 id="privacy-policy-for-byeai">Privacy Policy for ByeAI</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 12, 2025</p>
<p>Thank you for using ByeAI (“we”, “us”, “our”). We are committed to
protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information
we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your information.
Our guiding principle is to collect the minimum data necessary to
operate our service effectively and anonymously.</p>
<h3 id="information-we-collect">Information We Collect</h3>
<p>To provide a community-based filtering service, we collect a limited
amount of non-personally identifiable information when you flag a
video:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anonymous User Hash (<code>clientHash</code>):</strong> When
you first install the extension, a single, randomly generated 128-bit
UUID is created and stored locally on your computer. This hash is sent
with your votes to prevent duplicate voting and to anonymously track
reputation. It is not linked to your identity in any way.</li>
<li><strong>Vote Data:</strong> When you flag a video, we collect the
YouTube Video ID, the category you selected (e.g., “AI-script”), the
timestamp, and the video’s view count.</li>
<li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong>
collect, store, or have access to your IP address, email address, name,
or YouTube browsing history.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-we-use-information">How We Use Information</h3>
<p>The anonymous data we collect is used exclusively to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Calculate a community “score” for each flagged video.</li>
<li>Determine if a video’s score has met the threshold to be hidden for
all ByeAI users.</li>
<li>Anonymously adjust the reputation of the <code>clientHash</code>
based on community consensus.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="opt-in-analytics">Opt-In Analytics</h3>
<p>We use a self-hosted instance of Plausible Analytics, a
privacy-focused analytics platform, to understand how our extension is
used. This is <strong>strictly opt-in</strong>. If you do not enable it
in the settings, no analytics data is collected.</p>
<p>If you opt-in, we collect anonymous, aggregate data such as the
number of votes cast and which categories are most popular. This helps
us improve the service. You can view Plausible’s data policy <a
href="https://plausible.io/data-policy">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="data-sharing-and-open-source">Data Sharing and Open Source</h3>
<p>In the spirit of transparency and open source, we may periodically
publish anonymized dumps of the vote data. This data will not contain
any <code>clientHash</code> identifiers.</p>
<h3 id="data-security">Data Security</h3>
<p>We are committed to protecting your information and use standard
security measures to protect our servers and database.</p>
<h3 id="changes-to-this-policy">Changes to This Policy</h3>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify
you of any changes by posting the new policy on this page.</p>
